following customizations:

you will be talking about our project on yours root, but we still would appreciate it.
2. check the filepaths in scripts, workflows and hyperlinks in markdown documentation,
your project's hierarchical structure can differ from this one.
3. assemble required for you workflows and scrap any that wouldn't fit in your
repository.
4. assemble required for you dealings documentations, scrap that won't fit for
repository.
5. inspect the scripts directory for remaining scripts of this project, if you
can have any ideas about what to add, we would like to see your's contribution.
6. inspect the licensing files-in-repository, includes code of conduct, if you
can have any ideas about what to add, we would like to see your's contribution.
7. —Åonfirm that email addresses and contact information within the documentation 
or configuration files reflect the appropriate contact points for your project.
